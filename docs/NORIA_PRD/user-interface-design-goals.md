# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Noria provides a clean, mobile-first coaching experience that clearly distinguishes itself from AI companionship apps. The interface emphasizes clarity, progress, and motivation without manipulation. Users should feel they're engaging with a professional coach, not a digital friend, with every interaction building toward real-world social confidence.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **WhatsApp-Style Conversation**: Single persistent thread between user and AI coach for natural, continuous coaching dialogue
- **Implicit Progress Feedback**: Progress communicated through improved coaching quality and encouraging messages rather than gamified dashboards
- **Crisis-Aware Design**: Immediate resource overlays when safety concerns are detected without disrupting conversation flow
- **Coaching Clarity**: Clear visual distinction from companion apps through professional coaching branding and messaging

### Core Screens and Views

- Welcome & Onboarding Flow (coaching model explanation, goal selection, agreement)
- Main Chat Interface (persistent conversation with Noria AI coach)
- Profile Management (goals, privacy settings, account info)
- Wellness Resource Library (mental health resources, crisis helplines)
- Crisis Support Overlay (immediate resources when triggered)

### Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA

Full compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure inclusive access for all college students, including those with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities.

### Branding

Professional coaching aesthetic that clearly differentiates from entertainment AI companions:
- Clean, clinical interface design suggesting professional development
- "Noria - Your AI Coach" branding (never friend/companion)
- Encouraging but not manipulative progress messaging
- Evidence-based methodology communicated through design choices

### Target Device and Platforms

Web Progressive Web App (PWA) optimized for mobile-first usage across iOS Safari, Android Chrome, and desktop browsers. PWA features include home screen installation, push notifications, and offline message queuing.
