# Goals and Background Context

### Goals

• Graduate college students from AI dependency to authentic human relationships
• Provide evidence-based social coaching that builds real friendship skills 
• Create the first AI social platform designed to reduce rather than increase digital dependency
• Achieve 70% user graduation rate through measurable conversation quality improvement
• Establish sustainable business model focused on transformation outcomes rather than engagement metrics
• Validate novel 3-stage progression methodology (Individual → Small Group → Real World)

### Background Context

60% of college students experience severe loneliness despite being surrounded by peers. Current AI companion solutions (Replika, Character.AI) optimize for engagement and retention, creating digital dependency that worsens real-world social isolation rather than solving it. Noria addresses this by being the first AI social coaching platform designed to graduate users to authentic human relationships rather than create digital dependency.

Our evidence-based approach uses the ChAT (Conversational Human-likeness Assessment Tool) methodology to measure and improve conversation quality, helping users build genuine social confidence and friendship skills. Success is measured not by user retention, but by user graduation: students successfully completing our program and building meaningful real-world friendships, no longer needing our platform.
